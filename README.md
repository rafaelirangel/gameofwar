#WELCOME to Game of War!

####War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck and often played by children. There are many variations, as well as related games

##Rules
#####War, or Battle, is a played with two players and a standard 52 playing card deck. When a new game is started, the deck is shuffled. In War, cards are ranked Aces high and 2s low. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards in the deck.

##Set Up

##Game Play
#####Both players place the top card of their deck onto the center of the table. The player whose card is higher in value takes both cards and places them on the bottom of their deck. If players play cards of the same value, then there is a war.

##War
#####Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

##Keep Score
#####The player who wins all of the cards, wins the game.
