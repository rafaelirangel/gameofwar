WELCOME to Game of War!

#War This is an exercise in creating the simple cardgame War using javascript and some other tools.

###The Rules of War When a new game is started, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt half the deck. Each player flips the top card from their deck at the same time to reaveal it. Whomever's card has the higher number gets to put both cards on the bottom of their deck. If the numbers are the same, the players each place three cards from the top of their deck facedown on the table, and flip a fourth card. Whichever player has the card of those two are higher wins the all of those facedown cards and the played cards. Repeat for another tie. A player wins when the other player has no cards left to play.

Game Rules:

War, or Battle, is a played with two players and a standard 52 playing card deck. In War, cards are ranked Aces high and 2s low. The objective of the game is to win all of the cards in the deck.

Set Up
Before gameplay can begin, a dealer must be selected. Each player draws one card from a shuffled deck. The player with the lowest card becomes the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck and passes out all of the cards one by one to themselves and their opponent. 

How to Play
Both players place the top card of their deck onto the center of the table. The player whose card is higher in value takes both cards and places them in a separate pile next to their deck. Once a player runs out of cards in their deck, they shuffle all of the cards in their win pile and continue to play.

If players play cards of the same value, then there is a war. Players will place three of their cards faced down on the table and draw again. The winner of the war takes both pairs of played cards and the three cards faced down, winning five of their opponentâ€™s cards. If both cards of the second draw are also equal, the process is repeated and three more cards are laid faced down.

The player who wins all of the cards, wins the game.
